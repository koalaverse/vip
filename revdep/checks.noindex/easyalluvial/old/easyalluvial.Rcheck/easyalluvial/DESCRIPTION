Description: Alluvial plots are similar to sankey diagrams and visualise categorical data 
    over multiple dimensions as flows. (Rosvall M, Bergstrom CT (2010) Mapping Change in 
    Large Networks. PLoS ONE 5(1): e8694. <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008694> 
    Their graphical grammar however is a bit more complex then that of a regular x/y 
    plots. The 'ggalluvial' package made a great job of translating that grammar into 
    'ggplot2' syntax and gives you many options to tweak the appearance of an alluvial 
    plot, however there still remains a multi-layered complexity that makes it difficult
    to use 'ggalluvial' for explorative data analysis. 'easyalluvial' provides a simple 
    interface to this package that allows you to produce a decent alluvial plot from any 
    dataframe in either long or wide format from a single line of code while also handling 
    continuous data. It is meant to allow a quick visualisation of entire dataframes 
    with a focus on different colouring options that can make alluvial plots a great 
    tool for data exploration.
