      \item Prediction of 1 single observation gave an error
      \item Only \eqn{k} instead of \eqn{k*(k-1)/2} \eqn{\rho}
      coefficients have been returned by svm (\eqn{k} number of classes),

    \item New method: \code{naiveBayes()} classifier for categorical predictors
    \item optimization of \code{read.matrix.csr()} which used to be rather slow
    \item Bug fixes for the \code{svm()} interface: when the data included
       categorical predictors, the scaling procedure did not only
       affect the metric variables, but also the binary variables
       in the model matrix.
    \item Function \code{scaclust()} removed. Bug has to be fixed. 
  }
}

    \code{svm} working for the 2d-classification case.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.3-7}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{svm()} now supports the matrix.csr format, as handled by the

    numeric) are scaled per default.
      
    \item A new \code{plot()} function for \code{svm()} objects
    visualizes classification
    models by plotting data and support vectors in the data input
    space, along with the class borders.
    
    \item A new generic \code{tune()} function allows parameter tuning
    of arbitrary functions using, e.g., boot strapping, or cross validation.

    and \code{rpart()}) do exist.

    required packages are not found
    \item \code{svm()} now interfaces LIBSVM 2.35 which is a bug fix release.
       A call with invalid parameters now no longer causes R to be
       terminated, and the C(++) code became completely silent.

  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.3-1}{

    removed)
    \item Bug fixes in \file{Rsvm.c} and \file{svm.R} (incomplete list
    of returned Support Vectors).
    \item Encapsulate kmeans call in \code{bclust()} in a \code{try()}
    construct, because kmeans gives an error when a cluster becomes
    empty (which can happen for almost every data set from time to
    time).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.2-0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added functions for bagged clustering, see help(bclust).
    \item \code{read.pnm()} and \code{write.pgm()} have been removed

       \item \eqn{\nu}-regression
       \item Formula Interface
       \item \eqn{k}-fold cross-validation
       }
       In addition, an introductory article is provided in directory
       \file{docs/} (\file{svmdoc.pdf}).
    \item \code{classAgreement()} now features an option to match factor levels
    \item updated API design for the fuzzy clustering functions
    (\code{cmeans()}, \code{cshell()}, \code{scaclust()}).
    Documentation updates and function name changes (\code{cmeanscl()}
    to \code{cmeans()}, \code{validity.measures()} to
    \code{fclustIndex()})
    
  }
}
