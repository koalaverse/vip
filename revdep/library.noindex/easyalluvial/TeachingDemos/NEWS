TeachingDemos version 2.12

* Made factors explicit in examples using data.frame since 
  the default for conversion to factors is changing.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.11

* Improvements in shadowtext function to work on log scales and defaults to higher resolution.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.10

* Modified z.test so that you can provide a sample mean and sample
  size instead of the raw data.

* Added digits function to compute digits of an integer

* Fixed zoomplot to work with R 3.0

* Fixed subplot function to work better in multi frame plots with type='fig'.

* Fixed minor (and potentially major) bugs in TkListView

New in TeachingDemos version 2.9

* Removed sd.g, limits.g, and stats.g functions that work with the qcc
  package as they are now included in qcc and don't need to be here
  any more.

* Added functions mdtxtStart, mdtxtStop, mdtxtComment, mdtxtSkip, and
  mdtxtPlot to create transcript files using MarkDown which can then
  be converted to common formats (pdf, MS Word, html, etc.) using the
  pandoc program.

* Changed names of plot.rgl.coin and plot.rgl.die to rgl.coin and
  rgl.die to prevent confusion with S3 methods for plot generic
  function.

* added function cor.rect.plot to demonstrate concept of correlation.

* Added USCrimes dataset

* Added linesfun argument to my.symbols so that the user can use
  functions like polygon in place of lines.

* Added function simfun to help with creating simulated data sets.

* Modified squishplot function to remove missing values in case the
  entire data is submitted as xlim and ylim.


New in TeachingDemos version 2.8

* Changed many functions to no longer use partial match of arguments,
  this makes the newer versions happy and results in better code.

* Internal changes to R2txt.R and gnuplot.R to use an environment
  rather than a list for storing package local variables, this
  eliminated the need for "<<-" and unlocking of bindings and makes
  the code cleaner.

* arguments xsize and ysize added to my.symbols to allow setting the
  size of the symbols using the scale of the x or y variable.

* new functions TkBuildDist and TkBuildDist2 to interactively create a
  (prior) distrbution.

* new function cal to plot calendars

* new 'animate' option for tkexamp

* new function 'petals' to play the petals around the rose game (and
  demonstrate a simple code obscuration).

* fixed bug in subplot when subplotting inside mfrow/mfcol figures.

* Added ldsgrowth dataset

* Modified subplot and other functions to no longer need cnvrt.coords.

* cnvert.coords is now depricated, use grconvertX and grconvertY from
  the graphics package instead.

* Functions identify.Map, identify.polylist, recenter.Map, and
  project.Map have been removed as there is now better functionality
  in the sp package.

* The state.vbm object has been moved to the maptools package.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.7

* new function ms.image for plotting images using my.symbols.

* new functions wdtxtStart and friends to insert transcript into MS Word.

* function vt.residsim to work with vis.test.

* fixed several functions that depend on tcltk but did not load it.

* Updated HWidentify and HTKidentify to give more control and clean up after.

* Removed exaple in subplot using rimage package since it is not
  current and potentially causes problems.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.6

* function vis.test and friends made available (was present before,
  but not in the Namespace).

* Fixed bug in tkexamp with checkboxes.

* Added 'outliers' dataset

New in TeachingDemos version 2.5

* New functions HWidentify and HTKidentify to label points being hovered over.

* Turned off clipping (par(xpd=TRUE)) inside of my.symbols so that
  subsequent points are plotted

* New function sigma.test for testing a single variance.


New in TeachingDemos version 2.4

* The squishplot function now calls plot.new before doing the
  calculations, fixs a bug when things have not been reset or if fig
  regions are not all the same size.  There is an argument that will
  turn this off if needed.

* New functions Pvalue.norm.sim, Pvalue.binom.sim,
  run.Pvalue.norm.sim, and run.Pvalue.binom.sim to simulate p-values.

* The subplot function can now accept strings such as "topleft" or
  "bottom" as the x argument (and does the appropriate thing).

* New function gp.splot to send surface plot info to gnuplot

* Changed the write char commands in the etxtStart family to remove
  warnings in 2.8.0

* Changed par settings in my.symbols.  Old way reset all pars which
  could cause some plotting in the wrong areas.  Now it only resets
  the pars that it changes.

* updated plot2script to use dput rather than deparse which does
  better line wrapping.  Also fixed the problem with the "box" command
  (though other functions could still have the same problem).

* Removed strip.shingle function as it no longer works and its
  intended purpose has been available in lattice for a while.

* tkexamp now has a 'print' option (defaults to FALSE) that will
  automatically print the results of the function evaluation.  This is
  useful for ggplot2 or lattice graphics that must be printed to be seen.

* Function TkPredict for visualizing predicted values from a
  regression model adjusting for other terms in the model.

* New datasets 'evap' and 'stork'

* state.vbm updated to spatial polygon data frame.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.3

* etxt* functions updated to use rawToChar(as.raw(0)) rather than '\000'

* new function TkListView for interactively looking at list structures.

* Removed strict dependence on the Tk packages, will only be loaded for functions that use them.

* new function updateusr to update usr coordinate system.

* new function pairs2 that works like the pairs function, but with 2
  matricies and plots the pairwise scatterplots between the matricies.

New in TeachingDemos version 2.2

* tkprogress was removed, use tkProgressBar in utils package (by
  Prof. Ripley) as a better version.

* New function spread.labs to spread coordinates out for adding labels
  to a plot.

For TeachingDemos version 2.1

*  Removed dependence on rgl and tcltk2 packages


New to TeachingDemos version 2.0

* TeachingDemos now has a NAMESPACE so you can access just parts of
  the package without loading everything.  Fewer packages are now
  loaded with it, so it should load smaller and faster.

* Some of the gui demonstrations (e.g. run.cor.examp) were rewritten
  using the tkrplot package so that the graph shows up in the same
  window as the controls.  Old versions will remain, but with the word
  "old" inserted into the name.  More will change eventually.

* Many of the examples sections have replaced \dontrun with
  if(interactive()) so that the examples can be run using the
  "examples" function (recommended to use ask=FALSE).

* clt.demo function will now allow you to specify parameters of the
  distributions and the exponential was replaced with a gamma (the
  defaults match the prior information).

* New function "tkexamp" for creating interactive
  examples/demonstrations of the effect of changing parameter values
  on a graph.

* New functions "dynIdentify" and "TkIdentify" which create a
  scatterplot, place labels on the points, then allow you to drag the
  labels to new locations.

* New function "col2grey" for getting an idea of how a graph will look
  if printed or copied to greyscale.

* New function "SensSpec.demo" to show how to move from Sensitivity
  and Specificity to predictive power positive and negative using an
  intuitive virtual population method rather than the explicit math of
  Bayes formula.

* New functions "TkApprox" and "TkSpline" to interactivly interpolate
  on graphs and find values, differences, derivatives.

* New function "tkprogress" for a popup progress bar window to show
  you how a loop is progressing.

* New functions "txtStart", "etxtStart", etc to create transcript
  files and script files of your session.  Final result is a text file
  or a text file that can be converted to postscript and others via
  the enscript program.  The later version can include copies of
  graphs.
