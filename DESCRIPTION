Description: A general framework for constructing variable importance plots from 
  various types of machine learning models in R. Aside from some standard model-
  specific variable importance measures, this package also provides model-
  agnostic approaches that can be applied to any supervised learning algorithm.
  These include 1) an efficient permutation-based variable importance measure, 
  2) variable importance based on Shapley values (Strumbelj and Kononenko, 
  2014) <doi:10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x>, and 3) the variance-based 
  approach described in Greenwell et al. (2018) <arXiv:1805.04755>. A 
  variance-based method for quantifying the relative strength of interaction 
  effects is also included (see the previous reference for details).
