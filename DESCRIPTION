Description: A general framework for constructing variable importance plots from 
  various types of machine learning models in R. Aside from some standard model-
  specific variable importance measures, this package also provides model-
  agnostic approaches that can be applied to any supervised learning algorithm.
  These include an efficient permutation-based variable importance measure as 
  well as novel approaches based on partial dependence plots (PDPs) and 
  individual conditional expectation (ICE) curves which are described in 
  Greenwell et al. (2018) <arXiv:1805.04755>. An experimental method for 
  quantifying the relative strength of interaction effects is also included (see 
  the previous reference for details).
